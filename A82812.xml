            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Majeſties moſt loyall Subjects the Lords and Commons in Parliament, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive that the Declaration which your Majeſty received from us at <hi>New-Market,</hi> was ſuch as did deſerve that cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your Majeſty was pleaſed to lay upon us, in that Speech which your Majeſty made to our Committees there, &amp; ſent in writing to both Houſes; our addreſſe therein being accompanied with plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, humility, and faithfulnes, we thought more proper for
<pb facs="tcp:172600:3"/>removing the diſtraction of the Kingdome, then if wee had then proceeded according to your Majeſties meſſage of the 20. of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> By which your Majeſty was pleaſed to deſire, that we would declare what we intended to doe for your Majeſty, and what we expected to be done for our ſelves. In both which wee have bin very much hindred by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties deniall to ſecure us and the whole Kingdome, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Militia as we had diverſe times moſt humbly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned, and yet we have not bin altogether negligent of either, having lately made good proceedings in preparing a booke of Rates to be paſſed in a Bill of Tunnage and Poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: and likewiſe the moſt materiall heads of thoſe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſires which we intended to make to your Majeſty for the good and contentment of your Majeſty and your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: but none of theſe could be perfected before the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome be put into ſafety, by ſetling the Militia; And untill your Majeſty ſhall be pleaſed to concurre with your Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in theſe neceſſary things, we hold it impoſſible for you to give the World or your people ſuch ſatisfaction concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the feares and jealouſies which we have expreſſed, as we hope your Majeſty hath already received touching that exception which you were pleaſed to take to Maſter <hi>Pyms</hi> Speech.</p>
            <p>As for your Majeſties feares and doubts, the ground whereof is from ſeditious Pamphlets and Sermons, we ſhall be as carefull to endeavour the removall, as ſoon as we ſhall underſtand what pamphlets and Sermons are by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty intended; as we have beene to prevent all dangerous Tumults. And if any extraordinary concourſe of people out of the City to WESTMINSTER, had the face and ſhew of tumult and danger in your Majeſties apprehenſion, it will appeare to bee cauſed by your Majeſties denyall of
<pb facs="tcp:172600:3"/>ſuch a Guard to your Parliament as they might have cauſe to conſide in, And by taking into White-hall ſuch a Guard for your ſelfe, as gave juſt cauſe of jealouſie to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and of terrour and offence to your people. Wee ſeeke nothing but your Majeſties Honour, and the peace and proſperity of your Kingdomes. And we are heartily ſorry wee have ſuch plentifull matter of an anſwer to that queſtion, whether you had violated our Lawes? Wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech your Majeſty to remember that the governement of this Kingdome as it was in a great part mannaged by your Miniſters before the beginning of this Parliament, conſiſted of many continued and multiplied Acts of violation of Lawes, the wounds whereof were ſcarcely healed, when the extremity of all theſe violations, was far exceeded by the late ſtrange and unheard of breach of our Lawes in the accuſation of the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> and the five Members of the Commons Houſe and in the proceedings thereupon: for which we have yet received no full ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>To your Majeſties next queſtion, Whether you had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied any Bill for the eaſe and ſecurity of your Subjects, wee wiſh we could ſtop in the midſt of our anſwer; that with much thankfulneſſe we acknowledg that your Majeſty hath paſt many good Bils full of contentment, and advantage to your people: But Truth and Neceſſity enforceth us to adde this, That even in or about the time of paſſing thoſe Bills, ſome deſigne or other had beene afoot, which if it had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken effect, would not only have deprived us of the fruit of thoſe Bils, but have reduced us to a worſe condition of confuſion then that wherein the <hi>Parliament</hi> found us.</p>
            <p>And if your Majeſty had asked us the third queſtion inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in that ſpeech, what we had done for your ſelfe, our
<pb facs="tcp:172600:4"/>anſwer would have been much more eaſie, That wee have paid two Armies wherewith the Kingdome was burthened laſt yeare; and have undergone the charge of the warre in <hi>Ireland</hi> at this time; when through many other exceſſive charges and preſſures, whereby your Subjects have bin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and the ſtocke of the Kingdome very much dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; which great miſchiefes, and the charges thereupon enſuing, have been occaſioned by the evil Counſels ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful with your Majeſty, which have and wil coſt this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome more then two millions; all which in Iuſtice ought to have been borne by your Majeſty.</p>
            <p>As for that free and generall pardon your Majeſty hath been pleaſed to offer, it can be no ſecurity to our feares and Iealouſies, for which your Majeſty ſeemes to propound it; becauſe they ariſe not from any guilt of our owne actions, but from the evill deſignes and attempts of others.</p>
            <p>To this our humble anſwer to that ſpeech, wee deſire to adde an information which we lately received fr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty governour of the Merchant adventurers at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> That an unknown perſon appertaining to the <hi>Lord Digby</hi> did lately ſollicite one <hi>Iames Henly</hi> a <hi>Mariner</hi> to goe to <hi>Elſenore,</hi> and to take charge of a ſhip in the fleet of the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> there prepared, which he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to Hull: In which fleet likewiſe he ſaid a great Armie was to be tranſported. And although we are not apt to give credit to informations of this nature, yet we cannot alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether thinke it fit to be neglected, but that it may juſtly ad ſomewhat to the weight of our feares and jealouſies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering with what circumſtances it is accompanied of the Lord <hi>Digbyes</hi> preceding expresſions in his Letter to her Majeſty, and Sir <hi>Lewis Dives;</hi> and your Majeſties ſucceeding

We are extreamly unſatisfied what an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance is, but well ſatisfied, that without Our Conſent it is nothing, not binding: And it is evident by the long time ſpent in this Argument, the neceſſitie and danger was not ſo imminent, but a Bill might have well been prepared, which if it ſhall yet be done with that due regard to Vs, and care of Our People, in the limitation of the power and other circumſtances, We ſhall recede from nothing We formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in that Anſwer to your Order, otherwiſe We muſt declare to all the world, That We are not ſatiſfied with, or ſhall ever allow Our Subjects to be bound by your printed Votes, of the fifteenth or ſixteenth of this moneth, or that under pretence of declaring what the Law of the Land is, you ſhall without Vs make a new Law, which is plainly the caſe of the <hi>Militia:</hi> And what is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:172600:7"/>this but to introduce an Arbitrarie way of Government?</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Pyms</hi> Speech, you will have found by what the Lord <hi>Compton,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Baynton</hi> brought from Vs, in anſwer to that Meſſage they brought to Vs, that as yet We reſt nothing ſatisfied in that particular.</p>
            <p>As for the ſeditious Pamphlets and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, We are both ſorry and aſhamed in ſo great a variety, and in which Our Rights, Honour and Authority, are ſo inſolently ſlighted and vilified, and in which the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and Freedome of Parliament is ſo much invaded and violated, it ſhould be asked of Vs to name any; the mentioning of the <hi>Proteſtation proteſted,</hi> the <hi>Apprentices Proteſtation, To your Tents, O Iſrael,</hi> or any other, would be too great an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for the reſt. If you thinke them not worth your inquiry, We have done. But We think it moſt ſtrange, to be told, that Our deniall of a Guard (which We yet never denied, but granted in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and under a Command at that time moſt accuſtomed in the Kingdom) or the deniall of any thing elſe (which is in Our power legally to deny) which in Our underſtanding (of which God hath ſurely given Vs ſome uſe) is not fit to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould be any excuſe for ſo dangerous concourſe of people, which not onely in our apprehenſion, but (we beleeve) in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:172600:7"/>of Law it ſelf, hath bin alwaies held moſt tumultuous and ſeditious. And We muſt wonder, what, and whence comes the Inſtructions and Informations that thoſe people have, who can ſo eaſily think themſelves obliged by the Proteſtation to aſſemble in ſuch a manner, for the defence of Priviledges, which cannot be ſo clearly known to any of them, and ſo negligently paſſe over the conſideration, and defence of Our Rights ſo beneficiall and neceſſary for themſelves, and ſcarce unknown to any of them, which by their Oathes of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Supremacy (and even by the ſame Proteſtation) they are at leaſt equally obliged to defend. And what interruptions ſuch kinde of Aſſemblies may be to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of future Parliaments (if not ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diſcountenanced and ſuppreſſed) We muſt adviſe you to conſider, as likewiſe whether both Our powers may not by ſuch meanes be uſurped, by hands not truſted by the Conſtitution of this Kingdom. For Our Guard, We referre you to Our anſwer to your Declaration.</p>
            <p>By that Queſtion of Violating your Lawes; by which We endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Our care and reſolution to obſerve them; We did not expect you would have been invited to have looked back ſo many yeers, for which you have had ſo ample Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; Neither looked We to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:172600:8"/>with the Actions of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters (then againſt the Lawes) whilſt We expreſſe ſo great a zeale for the preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of them, it being Our Reſolution, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on obſervation of the miſchief which then grew by Arbitrary power (though made plauſible to Vs by the ſuggeſtions of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and imminent danger, and take you heed ye fall not into the ſame errour upon the ſame ſuggeſtions) hereafter to keep the Rule Our ſelf, and to Our power require the ſame from all others: But above all, We muſt be moſt ſenſible of what you caſt upon Vs for requitall of thoſe good Bills you cannot denie. We have denied any ſuch Deſigne, and as God Almighty muſt judge in that point between Vs, who knowes Our upright intentions at the paſſing thoſe Lawes: So in the mean time We defy the Devill to prove that there was any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne (with Our knowledge or Privity) in or about the time of paſſing thoſe Bills, that had it taken effect could have depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Our ſubjects of the fruit of them: And therefore We demand full Reparation in this point, that We may be cleared in the ſight of all the world, and chiefly in the eyes of our loving Subjects, from ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and falſe an imputation as this is.</p>
            <p>We are far from denying what you have done, For We acknowledge the charge our people have ſuſtained in keeping the two
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:172600:8"/>Armies, and in relieving <hi>Ireland,</hi> of the which We are ſo ſenſible, that in regard of thoſe great Burthens Our People have undergone, We have and do patiently ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thoſe extreme perſonall wants, as Our Predeceſſours have been ſeldome put to, rather then We would preſſe upon them: which We hope (in time) will be conſidered on your parts.</p>
            <p>In Our offer of a Generall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pardon, Our intent was to compoſe and ſecure the generall condition of Our Subjects, conceiving that in theſe times of great Diſtractions, the good Lawes of the Land have not been enough obſerved; But it is a ſtrange world when Princes profered Favors are counted Reproaches: yet if you like not this Our offer We have done.</p>
            <p>Concerning any diſcourſes of Forreign Forces, though We have given you a full Anſwer in Ours to your laſt Declaration, yet We muſt tell you, We have neither ſo ill an opinion of Our own merit, or the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Our good Subjects, as to think Our ſelf in need of any Forreign Force to preſerve Vs from Oppreſſion (and We ſhall not need for any other purpoſe) but are confident (through Gods providence) not to want the good wiſhes and aſſiſtance of the whole Kingdome, being reſolved to build upon that ſure Foundation, the Law of the Land. And We take it very ill that any
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:172600:9"/>generall Diſcourſes betweene an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Perſon and a Mariner, or inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon Letters ſhould be able to prevail in matters ſo improbable in themſelves, and ſcandalous to Vs, for which We cannot but likewiſe ask Reparation, not onely for the vindicating of Our Own Honour, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thereby to ſettle the mindes of Our Subject<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For our return to Our Parliament, We have given you a full Anſwer in Ours to your Declaration, and you ought to look on Vs as not gone but driven (We ſay not by you, yet) from you. And if it be not ſo eaſie for you to make Our Reſidence in <hi>London</hi> ſo ſafe as We could deſire, We are, and will be contented that Our Parliament be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed to ſuch a place, where We may be fitly and ſafely with you. For though we are not pleaſed to be at this diſtance, yet yee are not to expect Our Preſence, Vntill ye ſhall both ſecure Vs concerning Our juſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Tumultuary inſolencies, And likewiſe give Vs ſatisfaction for thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable and Inſolent Scandals that are raiſed upon Vs.</p>
            <p>To conclude, As We have or ſhall not Refuſe any way agreeable to Iuſtice or Honour, which ſhall be offered to Vs for the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
